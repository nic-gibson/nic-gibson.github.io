There&rsquo;s the obvious things like a web browser (I <em>like</em> Safari but I <em>use</em> Chrome). A lot has changed since because I&rsquo;ve gone from a job where writing code was most of my job at MarkLogic to a job where writing code is something that I might do in order to get something in my job done (at Redis).</p><p>As I settle in at Redis, I&rsquo;ve been setting up my environment. It feels pretty similar to what I&rsquo;ve used before although I don&rsquo;t need any XML tools at all. I&rsquo;ve never actually written down what I use nor have I really thought about justifying to myself why I use the tools I use.</p><p>The suite of software I actually use day to day has got smaller in many ways. By that, I mean that much much more of it lives in a browser these days, particularly at Redis. Apart from a browser, I don&rsquo;t actually need any other software than the three (four if you count fonts) below.</p><p><em>Obviously</em> (&lsquo;cos I <em>am</em> a techie), I use git, python, ssh and a whole slew of command line tools but I tend to think of those as the things I used <em>in</em> my working environment.</p><h2 id=iterm2>iTerm2</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve only just switched to iTerm2. I&rsquo;ve been an Apple Terminal user for ever despite friends and colleagues telling me I should switch. I tend to use solarized light themes. I found one for iTerm2 <a href=https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes>on github</a>.</p><p>Fundamentally, the panes are ridiculously useful when I&rsquo;m looking at a cluster.</p><h2 id=visual-studio-code>Visual Studio Code</h2><p>Once upon a time I lived in vim. My fingers are still programmed to use it. It was the first thing I checked was installed on any new system I used.</p><p>A few years ago a colleague released VS Code integrations for MarkLogic in VS Code. At the time I was trying to get into using IntelliJ ecause it had a good MarkLogic plugin. But.. being that sort of person (geek/techie/whatever) I thought that I would try this new editor. I&rsquo;m not a Microsoft fan (OK, I have always liked SQL Server and I made a fair amount of income from extending Visual Basic years ago) but it was worth a try.</p><p>Step forward a few years and it&rsquo;s my primary editor whatever operating system I happen to be running. I&rsquo;ve got the hang of its git integration too. That might actually end my love affair with Tower as a git client.</p><h2 id=zsh--oh-my-zsh>zsh & oh-my-zsh</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve used zsh for many years <a href=https://twitter.com/TheSamoth>@Samoth</a> talked me into trying when I worked with him at Cocoon Internet. Nowadays, I find that <a href=https://ohmyz.sh>oh my zsh</a> automates most of the customisations I used anyway.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no real justification for using zsh except that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to it and productive with it&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;ll do.</p><h2 id=fonts>Fonts</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve also got into the habit of using a coding specialised font with ligatures. I like <a href=https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode>Fira Code</a>, ymmv. I use it as both my terminal and editing font.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-silver bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3 no-underline" href=https://noslogan.org/>&copy; newt@noslogan 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
