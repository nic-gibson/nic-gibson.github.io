We visited the theme parks, they were OK. Disney is much more mellow than Universal; there are some great rides at both but Owen and I (the ride fans) like roller coaster rich environments best really.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also went to the Kennedy Space Center. It&amp;rsquo;s been thirty something years since I was last there and I was a bit bemused to find it has become theme parked.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Local Walks</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/photos/walks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:07:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/photos/walks/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just some pictures from recent local walks&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Broad-bodied Chaser</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/photos/broad-bodied-chaser/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/photos/broad-bodied-chaser/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was helping my son mow my neighbour&amp;rsquo;s garden yesterday when something flew past me. My first thought was “that was a &lt;em>huge&lt;/em> wasp” but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it well. Then I saw movement and realised it was a dragonfly. I&amp;rsquo;m rather fond of dragonflies. This lovely creature let me take photos of her (I &lt;em>think&lt;/em> it&amp;rsquo;s a female but it could be an immature male). &lt;a href="https://british-dragonflies.org.uk/species/broad-bodied-chaser/">She&amp;rsquo;s a broad-bodied chaser&lt;/a>. I imagine that she hatched from our neighbour&amp;rsquo;s pond.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
