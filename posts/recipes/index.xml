Most of the moisture comes from the steamed, mashed squash but you&amp;rsquo;d never know (good for those people who hate the idea of vegetables in cake).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve got two versions, one vegan, one not. I actually think the vegan one is better usually.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vegetarian Christmas Raised Pie</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/vegetarian-christmas-raised-pie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/vegetarian-christmas-raised-pie/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wanted to use a hot water crust pastry to make a Christmas main course. Given that we don&amp;rsquo;t eat meat, raised pork pies weren&amp;rsquo;t going to work. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a Christmas pie before that used butter beans, cheese, garlic and herbs so I decided to work from that and a raised pork pie and create a new recipe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sourdough Pancakes</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/pancakes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/pancakes/</guid><description>&lt;p>This always feels like cheating because there&amp;rsquo;s baking soda and powder as well as sourdough but it makes really tasty pancakes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chocolate Pecan Chunk Cookies</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/chocolate-chunk-cookies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/chocolate-chunk-cookies/</guid><description>&lt;p>This recipe is so easy. I think I originally got it from a cookbook that I ordered from Carnation. The condensed milk makes the cookies softer. You can use almost any nuts. I&amp;rsquo;ve used pecans, hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts in the past.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pavlova</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/pavlova/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 09:15:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/pavlova/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love pavlova. There seem to be &lt;em>so&lt;/em> many different recipe variations for the meringue. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried loads but I always come back to this one. My mum gave this one to me about twenty years ago. This recipe has never let me down. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried ones from cookbooks and the meringue just hasn&amp;rsquo;t worked as well. This works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The raspberry and passion fruit is our addition; you can use any fruit you like.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
