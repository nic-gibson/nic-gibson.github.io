We bought bread there. In particular we loved their Battersea Brown wholemeal bread. We moved to Sussex and there was sadness because we couldn&amp;rsquo;t buy the bread anymore. I mentioned this to the lovely people who ran the bakery. Clearly, we weren&amp;rsquo;t the first because they had a printed copy of the recipe and method ready to hand over.</description></item><item><title>Broad-bodied Chaser</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/broad-bodied-chaser/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/broad-bodied-chaser/</guid><description>I was helping my son mow my neighbour&amp;rsquo;s garden yesterday when something flew past me. My first thought was “that was a huge wasp” but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it well. Then I saw movement and realised it was a dragonfly. I&amp;rsquo;m rather fond of dragonflies. This lovely creature let me take photos of her (I think it&amp;rsquo;s a female but it could be an immature male). She&amp;rsquo;s a broad-bodied chaser. I imagine that she hatched from our neighbour&amp;rsquo;s pond.</description></item></channel></rss>
