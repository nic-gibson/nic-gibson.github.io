There seem to be so many different recipe variations for the meringue. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried loads but I always come back to this one. My mum gave this one to me about twenty years ago. This recipe has never let me down. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried ones from cookbooks and the meringue just hasn&amp;rsquo;t worked as well. This works.
The raspberry and passion fruit is our addition; you can use any fruit you like.</description></item><item><title>Programming</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/programming/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 16:25:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/programming/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the things that I use to do my job. There&amp;rsquo;s the obvious things like a web browser (I like Safari but I use Chrome). A lot has changed since because I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from a job where writing code was most of my job at MarkLogic to a job where writing code is something that I might do in order to get something in my job done (at Redis).</description></item><item><title>Local Walks</title><link>https://noslogan.org/walks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:07:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/walks/</guid><description>Just some pictures from recent local walks</description></item><item><title>Battersea Brown</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/battersea-brown/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/battersea-brown/</guid><description>A long time ago in a city not so far away (Battersea), there was the Lighthouse Bakery. We bought bread there. In particular we loved their Battersea Brown wholemeal bread. We moved to Sussex and there was sadness because we couldn&amp;rsquo;t buy the bread anymore. I mentioned this to the lovely people who ran the bakery. Clearly, we weren&amp;rsquo;t the first because they had a printed copy of the recipe and method ready to hand over.</description></item><item><title>Broad-bodied Chaser</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/broad-bodied-chaser/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/broad-bodied-chaser/</guid><description>I was helping my son mow my neighbour&amp;rsquo;s garden yesterday when something flew past me. My first thought was “that was a huge wasp” but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it well. Then I saw movement and realised it was a dragonfly. I&amp;rsquo;m rather fond of dragonflies. This lovely creature let me take photos of her (I think it&amp;rsquo;s a female but it could be an immature male). She&amp;rsquo;s a broad-bodied chaser. I imagine that she hatched from our neighbour&amp;rsquo;s pond.</description></item></channel></rss>
