&lt;p>It makes 8 fluffy pitas. I generally don&amp;rsquo;t use the kitchen oven for these because the pizza oven makes great pitas. You can also use a pizza stone in a regular oven if you give it plenty of time to heat up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vegetarian Christmas Raised Pie</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/vegetarian-christmas-raised-pie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/vegetarian-christmas-raised-pie/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wanted to use a hot water crust pastry to make a Christmas main course. Given that we don&amp;rsquo;t eat meat, raised pork pies weren&amp;rsquo;t going to work. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a Christmas pie before that used butter beans, cheese, garlic and herbs so I decided to work from that and a raised pork pie and create a new recipe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How much yeast?</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/bread/yeast/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/bread/yeast/</guid><description>&lt;p>I always forget how much of each different type of yeast to use.

They are best when you eat them absolutely fresh. Just make sure they are cooked &lt;em>enough&lt;/em>. They aren&amp;rsquo;t like the one you buy in the supermarket - they&amp;rsquo;re a bit more dense. You can cook them until they start to brown.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sourdough Pancakes</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/pancakes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/pancakes/</guid><description>&lt;p>This always feels like cheating because there&amp;rsquo;s baking soda and powder as well as sourdough but it makes really tasty pancakes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chocolate Pecan Chunk Cookies</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/chocolate-chunk-cookies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/chocolate-chunk-cookies/</guid><description>&lt;p>This recipe is so easy. I think I originally got it from a cookbook that I ordered from Carnation. The condensed milk makes the cookies softer. You can use almost any nuts. I&amp;rsquo;ve used pecans, hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts in the past.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pavlova</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/pavlova/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 09:15:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/recipes/pavlova/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love pavlova. There seem to be &lt;em>so&lt;/em> many different recipe variations for the meringue. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried loads but I always come back to this one. My mum gave this one to me about twenty years ago. This recipe has never let me down. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried ones from cookbooks and the meringue just hasn&amp;rsquo;t worked as well. This works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The raspberry and passion fruit is our addition; you can use any fruit you like.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Battersea Brown</title><link>https://noslogan.org/posts/bread/battersea-brown/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noslogan.org/posts/bread/battersea-brown/</guid><description>&lt;p>A long time ago in a city not so far away (Battersea), there was the Lighthouse
Bakery. We bought bread there. In particular we loved their &lt;strong>Battersea Brown&lt;/strong>
wholemeal bread. We moved to Sussex and there was sadness because we couldn&amp;rsquo;t buy
the bread anymore. I mentioned this to the lovely people who ran the bakery.
Clearly, we weren&amp;rsquo;t the first because they had a printed copy of the recipe and
method ready to hand over.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
