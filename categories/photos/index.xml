My first thought was “that was a &lt;em>huge&lt;/em> wasp” but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it well. Then I saw movement and realised it was a dragonfly. I&amp;rsquo;m rather fond of dragonflies. This lovely creature let me take photos of her (I &lt;em>think&lt;/em> it&amp;rsquo;s a female but it could be an immature male). &lt;a href="https://british-dragonflies.org.uk/species/broad-bodied-chaser/">She&amp;rsquo;s a broad-bodied chaser&lt;/a>. I imagine that she hatched from our neighbour&amp;rsquo;s pond.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
